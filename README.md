# string-mismatch

This library share functions for compare two strings and see the differences between them.

## Install

```
npm install --save string-mismatch
```

## Getting started

Example of how to use the library for see the differences between two strings:

```
var sm = require('../src/string-mismatch');

var start = 'This is a test for see how work the library',
    end   = 'This is a test for know how work the new library';

console.log(sm.diff(start, end, 5));
/*
result:
[
  {
    mtc: 'This is a test for ',
    del: 'see',
    ins: 'know',
    sbs: ' how work the '
  }, {
    mtc: '',
    del: '',
    ins: 'new ',
    sbs: 'library'
  }
]
*/
```

The result is an object array with the mismatch result. Each object with the next structure:

```
{
  mtc: string, // Start of the sub-string
  del: string, // Deleted sub-string from the start string
  ins: string, // New sub-string added in the end string
  sbs: string  // End of the sub-string
}
```

The resulting string can be concatenated like the next example:

```
var sm = require('../src/string-mismatch');

var start = 'This is a test for see how work the library',
    end   = 'This is a test for know how work the new library';

console.log(sm.diff(start, end, 5).reduce(function (text, value) {
    return text + value.mtc + (value.del ? '(-' + value.del +')' : '') + (value.ins ? '(+' + value.ins + ')' : '') + value.sbs;
}, ''));
/*
result:
This is a test for (-see)(+know) how work the (+new )library
*/
```

This code can be see in the project examples. To run the examples use the next command:

```
npm start
```
